## The Problem

Recently Florida State University(FSU) has decided to move from Blackboard to Canvas for their online content delivery in courses.  Though not the same, a lot of the content is familiar to where you can pick up and go with it.  One great convienience of Blackboard was having an instructor/TA(teacher assistant) forum where we could collaborate without email.  I'm here to tell you that on Canvas, it is possible but not immediately apparent.

## The Solution

* Open the People tab then click "+ Group Set"
* Give it a name like "Instructors".  Leave everything default.
* There should be zero students in this group.
* Create a discussion
* Checkmark This is a Group Discussion
* Set Group Set to "Instructors"
* Save & Publish

## Explanation

Instructors are implicity in every group.  So there is no signup required!
